✅ Must-Know Java Concepts for Backend Developer (1 YOE)

1. Java Basics & OOP
 -	Data types, variables, operators
 -	Type casting, wrapper classes, autoboxing/unboxing
 -	Access modifiers (public, protected, default, private)
 -	OOP principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
 -	this and super keywords
 -	static keyword (variables, methods, blocks, nested classes)
 -	Constructors (default, parameterized, copy constructor)


2. Collections Framework
 -	List, Set, Map, Queue – differences, use cases
 -	Implementations: ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, PriorityQueue
 -	Fail-fast vs fail-safe iterators
 -	Comparable vs Comparator
 -	Hashing concepts (hashCode(), equals())
 -	Time complexities of major collections



3. Exception Handling
 -	try-catch-finally
 -	Checked vs Unchecked exceptions
 -	throw vs throws
 -	Custom exceptions
 -	Best practices (e.g., don’t swallow exceptions, logging)



4. Java Memory & JVM
 -	JVM architecture (ClassLoader, Method Area, Heap, Stack, GC)
 -	Stack vs Heap memory
 -	Garbage Collection basics (GC roots, minor vs major GC)
 -	Strong, Weak, Soft, Phantom references
 -	final, finally, finalize() differences



5. Strings & Immutable Classes
 -	String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer differences
 -	Why String is immutable?
 -	String pool (interning)
 -	Creating immutable classes in Java



6. Concurrency & Multithreading (Basic Level for 1 YOE)
 -	Thread lifecycle (new, runnable, running, waiting, terminated)
 -	Creating threads (Thread class, Runnable interface)
 -	synchronized keyword
 -	volatile keyword basics
 -	Thread safety issues (race conditions, deadlocks)
 -	Executor framework (ExecutorService, Future, Callable) – at least basic idea



7. Java 8+ Features (Frequently Asked)
 -	Functional interfaces (@FunctionalInterface)
 -	Lambda expressions
 -	Method references
 -	Streams API (map, filter, reduce, collect, flatMap)
 -	Optional class
 -	Default and static methods in interfaces



8. File Handling & I/O
 -	File, FileReader, FileWriter
 -	BufferedReader, BufferedWriter
 -	InputStream, OutputStream
 -	Serialization & Deserialization basics



9. Core Utility Concepts
 -	Generics (List<String>, wildcards ? extends, ? super)
 -	Enums
 -	Varargs (...)
 -	Annotations (built-in and custom)
 -	Reflection basics (Class, Method, Field)
 -	Object class methods (equals, hashCode, toString, clone, wait/notify)



10. Coding & Problem-Solving (Service-based companies love this)
 -	Implement basic DS & Algo problems in Java:
 -	Arrays (search, sort, frequency counts)
 -	Strings (reverse, palindrome, anagram, substring)
 -	Collections usage (grouping, frequency map)
 -	OOP-based small designs (Library system, Employee management, etc.)
