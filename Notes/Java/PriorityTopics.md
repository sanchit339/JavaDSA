Perfect 👍 Let’s break it down into priority buckets so you know what to master first for interviews in service-based MNCs (India, 1 YOE backend Java role):



🎯 High-Probability Topics (Must-Master)

These are almost guaranteed to be asked.
👉 Spend 70% of your prep time here.
1.	OOP Concepts
 -	Inheritance, Polymorphism (runtime vs compile-time), Abstraction, Encapsulation
 -	static, this, super
 -	Access modifiers
2.	Collections Framework
 -	List, Set, Map + main implementations (ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, TreeMap)
 -	equals() vs hashCode() contract
 -	Comparable vs Comparator
 -	Iterators & fail-fast vs fail-safe
 -	Time complexities
3.	Exception Handling
 -	Checked vs Unchecked exceptions
 -	throw vs throws
 -	try-catch-finally flow
 -	Custom exceptions
4.	Java 8 Features
 -	Lambdas & Functional Interfaces
 -	Streams API (map, filter, reduce, collect)
 -	Method references
 -	Optional usage
5.	String Handling
 -	String immutability
 -	String pool
 -	String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer



⚡ Medium-Probability Topics (Likely to be touched upon)

👉 Spend ~20% time here.
6.	Multithreading Basics
 -	Thread lifecycle
 -	Creating threads (Thread, Runnable)
 -	synchronized, volatile basics
 -	Deadlock concept (at least theoretically)
 -	Basic idea of ExecutorService
7.	Java Memory / JVM Basics
 -	Stack vs Heap
 -	Garbage Collection basics
 -	final, finally, finalize() differences
8.	Generics & Core Utilities
 -	Generic methods & wildcards (? extends, ? super)
 -	Enums
 -	Varargs (...)



🟢 Good-to-Know (Safe Zone / Bonus Points)

👉 Spend ~10% time (if extra time before interviews).
9.	Reflection Basics
 -	Class<?>, Method, Field
 -	When to use (frameworks like Spring use it heavily)
10.	File I/O & Serialization

 -	File, BufferedReader, InputStream vs Reader
 -	Serialization basics (Serializable, transient)

11.	Object Class Methods

 -	toString(), equals(), hashCode()
 -	clone()
 -	wait(), notify(), notifyAll() (just basic awareness)



🔥 Quick Formula for Service-Based MNCs
 -	Guaranteed Topics → OOP, Collections, Exception Handling, Java 8, Strings
 -	Often Asked → Multithreading basics, JVM, Generics
 -	Nice-to-Have → Reflection, File I/O, Object methods

👉 If you can code small problems using Collections + Streams, explain OOP with examples, and answer theory around exceptions & multithreading, you’ll be in the safe zone.
