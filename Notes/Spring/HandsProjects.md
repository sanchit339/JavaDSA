🔥 Mini-Projects for Spring Boot (Practical + Interview-Oriented)



1. Employee Management System (CRUD + REST + JPA)

Topics Covered:
 -	Spring Boot REST API (@RestController, @GetMapping, etc.)
 -	Spring Data JPA (CRUD, pagination, sorting)
 -	Exception handling (@ControllerAdvice)
 -	Validation (@Valid)
 -	Logging with SLF4J

Features:
 -	Add / update / delete employee
 -	Fetch employee by ID, all employees, paginated list
 -	Search employee by name (using findByNameContaining)
 -	Global exception handler for invalid IDs

📌 This project alone covers 50% of service-company backend questions.



2. Library Management API (Relationships + JPA)

Topics Covered:
 -	Entity relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)
 -	Lazy vs Eager loading
 -	@Transactional
 -	Custom queries with @Query

Features:
 -	Books & Authors (Many-to-Many)
 -	Fetch books by author, fetch authors of a book
 -	Transactions: Borrowing a book reduces stock count

📌 Helps when they ask JPA relationship questions (“Explain One-to-Many with example”).



3. User Authentication API (Spring Security + JWT)

Topics Covered:
 -	Spring Security basics (Authentication & Authorization)
 -	JWT (JSON Web Token)
 -	Password hashing (BCryptPasswordEncoder)
 -	Role-based access control

Features:
 -	Register new users (hashed passwords)
 -	Login → Generate JWT
 -	Secure endpoint /admin/* accessible only to ADMIN users

📌 Even a basic working JWT auth demo impresses interviewers a lot.



4. Expense Tracker API (Microservices + Caching + Actuator)

Topics Covered:
 -	Microservices (split into 2 small services)
 -	Spring Boot Actuator (/health, /info)
 -	Caching (@Cacheable, @CacheEvict)
 -	Profiles (dev/test/prod configs)

Features:
 -	Service 1 → User Management (basic CRUD)
 -	Service 2 → Expense Management (CRUD, total expenses, group by category)
 -	Cached API → “Get all expenses by user”
 -	Actuator endpoints enabled

📌 Even a 2-service demo is enough to explain microservices concepts practically.



5. Order Management System (Testing + Async)

Topics Covered:
 -	Unit Testing (@SpringBootTest, Mockito)
 -	Integration Testing (@WebMvcTest)
 -	Async processing (@Async)
 -	Event listeners (ApplicationEventPublisher)

Features:
 -	Place an order → triggers async email notification
 -	Test REST endpoints using MockMvc
 -	Use event publishing for order confirmation

📌 Covers modern Spring Boot interview expectations (testing + async).



🎯 Strategy for Projects in Interviews

Instead of just listing projects, use them to answer questions:
 -	If they ask “What is Dependency Injection?” → “In my Employee Management project, I injected the EmployeeRepository into the EmployeeService using @Autowired instead of manually instantiating it.”
 -	If they ask “Explain Lazy vs Eager loading” → “In my Library Management API, I initially faced performance issues when fetching authors with books eagerly. I switched to LAZY fetch and solved the issue.”
 -	If they ask “How do you handle exceptions in Spring Boot?” → “In my Expense Tracker, I used a global exception handler with @ControllerAdvice to return consistent error responses.”

👉 This way, your answers become practical and experience-backed instead of textbook.



📌 Recommendation:
Do Project 1 (Employee API) first → then add features (validation, exception handling, logging).
Next, expand into Project 2 (Library) for JPA relationships.
If time permits → do Project 3 (JWT Security) (huge impact in interviews).
