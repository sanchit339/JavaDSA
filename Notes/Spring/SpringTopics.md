 -	Spring Bean lifecycle (@PostConstruct, @PreDestroy, init/destroy methods)



2. Spring Boot Fundamentals
 -	What is Spring Boot? How it differs from Spring?
 -	Auto-configuration & spring-boot-starter-* dependencies
 -	application.properties / application.yml usage
 -	@SpringBootApplication annotation (meta-annotations: @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan)
 -	Profiles (@Profile) for dev/test/prod environments



3. REST APIs with Spring Boot
 -	Building REST controllers (@RestController, @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.)
 -	@PathVariable, @RequestParam, @RequestBody, @ResponseBody
 -	HTTP status codes & ResponseEntity<T>
 -	Exception handling in REST: @ControllerAdvice, @ExceptionHandler
 -	Validation with @Valid + Hibernate Validator



4. Spring Data JPA
 -	Repository types: CrudRepository, JpaRepository
 -	Derived query methods (findByName, findByAgeGreaterThan)
 -	JPQL vs Native Queries (@Query)
 -	Entity relationships: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many (lazy vs eager loading)
 -	Transactions (@Transactional) basics
 -	Pagination & Sorting



5. Spring Boot Internals & Practical Topics
 -	How auto-configuration works (Spring Boot starters)
 -	Difference: @Component, @Service, @Repository
 -	Custom annotations in Spring
 -	Bean validation (@NotNull, @Size, @Email)
 -	Logging (slf4j, logback)



âš¡ Medium-Probability Topics (Often Asked)

6. Spring Security Basics
 -	Authentication vs Authorization
 -	Basic Auth, JWT-based authentication (basic understanding, not full implementation)
 -	Method-level security (@PreAuthorize, @Secured)



7. Microservices Basics
 -	Difference: Monolith vs Microservices
 -	Why microservices?
 -	Communication methods: REST, Feign Client, gRPC (just awareness)
 -	Service Discovery basics (Eureka, Consul â€“ even just theory is fine)



8. Spring Boot Actuator & Monitoring
 -	What is Actuator?
 -	Common endpoints: /health, /info, /metrics
 -	Use case in production monitoring



9. Caching in Spring
 -	@Cacheable, @CacheEvict annotations
 -	Simple cache vs Redis integration (theory is fine at 1 YOE)



10. Testing in Spring Boot
 -	Unit tests with JUnit & Mockito
 -	@SpringBootTest, @WebMvcTest
 -	Mocking Repositories & Services



ðŸŸ¢ Good-to-Know (Safe Zone / Bonus Points)
 -	Messaging basics (RabbitMQ, Kafka â€“ just awareness)
 -	Async in Spring (@Async, Future)
 -	Profiles + config server in microservices setup
 -	Docker basics for Spring Boot apps (common in MNC discussions now)
